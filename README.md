# Fetch

Fetch is a simple HTTP and REST API test client for the desktop built on Electron. Fetch does not
require account sign-up or store your data to a remote server. Fetch simply makes HTTP and HTTPS
requests, keeping your data private on your machine.

## Development

This section describes how to run Fetch in development mode. Node 18 or higher is required for
development. Notes that this project does not work with Node 23.

After you have installed Node and clone this repo, run the following to start the app in
development.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
